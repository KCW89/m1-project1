# Intentionally Incomplete Features (65-70% Implementation)

This sample answer implements **65-70% of the full Creative Studio app functionality** for educational purposes. The missing features are intentionally left for students to discover, research, and implement as part of their learning journey.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview: My Creative Studio
A photo editing and creative content app inspired by popular social media creation tools.

## ðŸš« Missing Features for Student Implementation

### 1. Advanced Photo Filters & Effects
**Why It's Missing**: Students need to learn real image processing techniques
**Current State**: Basic simulated effects using image manipulation (rotation, resize, flip)
**Student Challenge**: Implement true color filters, brightness/contrast adjustments, and artistic effects
**Implementation Hints**: 
- Research expo-gl-cpp or react-native-image-filter-kit
- Explore Canvas API for web-based effects
- Consider WebGL shaders for advanced effects
**Resources**: 
- [Expo GL documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/gl/)
- [Image processing tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial)

### 2. Real Drawing Canvas Implementation
**Why It's Missing**: Complex gesture handling and path rendering require advanced concepts
**Current State**: Basic touch point tracking with simple dot rendering
**Student Challenge**: Create smooth drawing paths with pressure sensitivity and shape tools
**Implementation Hints**:
- Use react-native-svg for vector-based drawing
- Implement Bezier curve smoothing for natural strokes
- Add shape tools (rectangle, circle, line)
**Resources**:
- [React Native SVG documentation](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg)
- [Drawing algorithms and smoothing techniques](https://medium.com/@ryan.michael.spencer/drawing-smooth-lines-in-canvas-html5-f0d43bd98cd7)

### 3. Text Overlay with Real Rendering
**Why It's Missing**: Complex positioning and styling systems need to be understood
**Current State**: Simple text positioning without actual rendering on image
**Student Challenge**: Render text directly onto images with custom fonts, effects, and positioning
**Implementation Hints**:
- Use Canvas API to render text onto images
- Implement drag-and-drop positioning
- Add text effects (shadow, outline, gradient)
**Resources**:
- [React Native Text styling](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props)
- [Custom font implementation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-custom-fonts/)

### 4. Social Sharing & Community Features
**Why It's Missing**: Backend integration and social features require full-stack knowledge
**Current State**: Basic device sharing only
**Student Challenge**: Build community feed, likes, comments, and user profiles
**Implementation Hints**:
- Design a backend API (Firebase, Supabase, or custom)
- Implement user authentication
- Create feed algorithms and content moderation
**Resources**:
- [Firebase for React Native](https://rnfirebase.io/)
- [Supabase React Native guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/react-native)

### 5. Advanced Gallery Management
**Why It's Missing**: File system operations and metadata handling are complex topics
**Current State**: Basic image selection from device gallery
**Student Challenge**: Create custom albums, tags, and advanced organization features
**Implementation Hints**:
- Implement SQLite for local metadata storage
- Add tagging and search functionality
- Create custom album creation and management
**Resources**:
- [SQLite with React Native](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite/)
- [File system operations](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem/)

### 6. Export & Format Options
**Why It's Missing**: Multiple file format handling requires understanding of codecs and compression
**Current State**: Basic JPEG export only
**Student Challenge**: Support multiple formats (PNG, GIF, WebP) with quality controls
**Implementation Hints**:
- Research expo-image-manipulator advanced options
- Implement format-specific optimizations
- Add batch export functionality
**Resources**:
- [Image formats and compression guide](https://web.dev/choose-the-right-image-format/)

### 7. Collaborative Editing
**Why It's Missing**: Real-time collaboration requires advanced networking and state management
**Current State**: Single-user editing only
**Student Challenge**: Enable real-time collaborative editing sessions
**Implementation Hints**:
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Use operational transforms for conflict resolution
- Design user presence indicators
**Resources**:
- [WebSocket implementation in React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/network#websocket-support)
- [Operational transformation concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation)

## ðŸ”§ Getting Students Unstuck

If students encounter issues:
1. **Performance Problems**: Guide them to image compression and lazy loading
2. **Complex UI**: Break down into smaller, reusable components
3. **State Management**: Introduce them to useReducer or state management libraries
4. **Device Testing**: Ensure testing on multiple devices and screen sizes
5. **Memory Issues**: Teach proper cleanup and image caching strategies

Remember: The goal is learning through discovery, not just feature completion!
