PLACEHOLDER NOTICE
==================

The following image files are NOT included in this template to keep the size small:

Required Images (to be added by instructor or auto-generated):
- icon.png (1024x1024) - App icon
- splash.png (2732x2732) - Splash screen
- adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024) - Android adaptive icon
- logo.png (200x200) - Example logo used in App.js

TEMPORARY SOLUTION FOR TESTING:
--------------------------------

The app will work without these images, but you may see warnings.

To add placeholder images quickly:

1. Use Expo default icons:
   - Expo will auto-generate if missing

2. Use web images temporarily in App.js:
   Replace:
   <Image source={require('./assets/logo.png')} />

   With:
   <Image source={{ uri: 'https://picsum.photos/200/200' }} />

3. Download sample assets:
   - Visit: https://expo.github.io/vector-icons/
   - Or use: https://unsplash.com/

The template code is complete and functional!
Images are cosmetic and can be added later.
